## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is derived from:

**The Minnesota Messenia Expedition: Reconstructing a Bronze Age Regional Environment**  
Edited by William A. McDonald and George R. Rapp Jr.  
University of Minnesota Press, 1972.

The publication presents the results of an archaeological regional survey in Messenia and Elis (Greece). The original work contains descriptive site records rather than a structured dataset.

This project transforms the published catalogue of archaeological sites into a relational SQL database.

This repository contains a partial dataset (sample subset)
used for demonstrating the database structure and analysis.

The full dataset is not included.

The database includes:

- Site locations and physical descriptions
- Archaeological interpretations
- Bibliographic references
- Chronological indicators (Early Helladic, Middle Helladic)
- Estimated site size
- Geomorphological classifications

The data were manually transcribed and structured from the original publication.

This dataset is provided for research and demonstration purposes only.

All original descriptions and interpretations are derived from the cited publication.
